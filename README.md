Key Features and Modules

1.face_detection.py:
Purpose: Detect human faces in images or video feeds.
Functions:
detect_faces(image): Takes an image input and returns the coordinates of detected faces.
Technology: Uses a pre-trained face detection model such as OpenCV's Haar cascades or a deep learning model like MTCNN.

2.mask_detection.py:
Purpose: Identify if a person is wearing a mask.
Functions:
detect_masks(image): Takes an image input and returns coordinates and mask status of faces.
Technology: Uses a CNN model trained on datasets containing masked and unmasked faces.

3.fire_detection.py:
Purpose: Detect presence of fire or smoke in images or video feeds.
Functions:
detect_fire(image): Takes an image input and returns a boolean indicating presence of fire or smoke.
Technology: Uses image processing techniques or deep learning models trained on fire detection datasets.

4.weapon_detection.py:
Purpose: Identify weapons in images or video feeds.
Functions:
detect_weapons(image): Takes an image input and returns coordinates of detected weapons.
Technology: Uses YOLO (You Only Look Once) model trained on weapon datasets.

5.threat_detection.py:
Purpose: Integrate all individual detection modules to provide a comprehensive threat detection system.
Functions:
detect_threats(image): Calls the individual detection functions and returns a consolidated list of detected threats.
Technology: Coordinates calls to other detection functions and aggregates results.

6.preprocessing.py:
Purpose: Preprocess images before detection to ensure consistency and improve accuracy.
Functions:
preprocess_image(image): Takes an image and performs operations like resizing, normalization, and noise reduction.
Technology: Uses OpenCV or similar libraries for image processing tasks.

7.device_interface.py:
Purpose: Interface with IoT devices for future integrations.
Functions:
connect_to_device(device_id): Placeholder for connecting to IoT devices.
send_alert(device_id, alert_message): Placeholder for sending alerts through IoT devices.
Technology: Placeholder functions, with plans to use protocols like MQTT for IoT communication.

8.real_time_monitor.py:
Purpose: Manage real-time video feeds and coordinate the detection process.
Functions:
start_monitoring(video_source): Starts real-time monitoring on a given video source (e.g., laptop camera).
process_frame(frame): Processes each frame of the video feed for threats.
Technology: Uses OpenCV for video capture and frame processing.

9.alerting.py:
Purpose: Handle alert generation and notifications based on detections.
Functions:
send_alert(alert_type, details): Sends an alert notification (e.g., email, SMS) based on the detected threat.
Technology: Uses libraries like smtplib for email alerts and Twilio API for SMS alerts.

10.timer_feature.py:
Purpose: Monitor detection events against a predefined schedule and trigger alerts if detections occur during unusual hours.
Functions:
is_unusual_time(timestamp): Checks if a given timestamp is outside of usual hours.
check_time_and_alert(detection): Triggers an alert if the detection is at an unusual time.
Technology: Uses datetime library to handle time-based checks.

11.main.py
Purpose: The main entry point for the project, initializing and coordinating all modules.
Functions:
main(): Sets up the project, initializes modules, and starts the real-time monitoring.
Technology: Coordinates the overall flow of the project, ensures all modules are properly initialized and functioning.
